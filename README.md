Environment Configuration

    Create a file named .env in the project's root directory. This file is used to securely store sensitive data such as passwords and API keys. Add the following lines, replacing the values with your actual configuration data:

    Name your token and select the expiration date.
    Set the necessary permissions for your token to suit your use case (at a minimum, permission to create work items).
    Click Create and copy the token. Be sure to store it in a secure location, as it will not be displayed again after creation.
